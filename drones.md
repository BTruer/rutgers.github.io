# Drones: Quadcopters
*Description:* The quadcopter division explores topics such as computer vision and image processing as well as hacking the hardware to interface with other devices. The meetings are structured as a series of workshops that build upon the previously taught concepts. Throughout the year there will be mini-projects to allow you to experiment with the topics. Our vision as the drone division is to inspire you to produce creative applications of drones. 

*Meeting Times:*  Tuesdays: 8:30-10pm
*Location:* EE-203 (check fb/groupme for any changes)
