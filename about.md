## Rutgers IEEE
Rutgers IEEE is a student branch of IEEE.
Our goal on campus is to provide out-of-classroom support to supplement our formal educations.
We put on technical workshops, host professional events, and lead semester-long projects to gain exposure to specific subjects.

## IEEE Membership
While membership in the Rutgers IEEE club is **free**, students may choose to join the IEEE parent organization for a student rate of ~$30 per year, to gain access to a large library of papers.
