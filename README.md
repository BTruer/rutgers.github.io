# Rutgers IEEE Website

Because we need some sort of web presence.

To future maintainers: this is an automatically generated static website.
Edit the files `_data/eboards.yml` and `_data/teams.yml` with updated information and push to regenerate the website.
If something breaks, yell at Revan.

To build locally, install the github pages gem: `sudo gem install -g github-pages` then `jekyll serve --watch`.
